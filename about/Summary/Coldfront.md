# Rain World: Coldfront - Summary

## Introduction

**Coldfront** is a mod that explores *Sliver Of Straw*'s solution to the Great Problem, according to my idea. The mod adds 10 new regions and over 20 sub-regions, along with a new campaign featuring a new slugcat. Its goal is to present a possible interpretation of the game's lore and further expand the existing universe.

## World

Coldfront adds 10 new regions, 9 of which belong to the *Sliver Of Straw* complex. Located further north, the cold is so intense that the heat generated by the structure is not enough to warm the complex. Therefore, the regions were designed to withstand the cold and darkness.

- **Converging Rails**: Rails that connect the world through a vast underground network.  
- **Underground Ice Rails**: Frozen rails that surround the *Sliver Of Straw* complex.  
- **Boreal Bazaar**: A large scavenger market illuminated by auroras.  
- **Glacial Reservoir**: A partially heated aquifer system.  
- **Atmospheric Filter**: Structures created to clean air pollution.  
- **Shadowed Waste**: A huge dark landfill where experimental results are discarded.  
- **Foundry District**: An industrial complex with large furnaces that warm the surrounding areas.  
- **Snowy Conservatory**: Suspended gardens, partially heated to preserve plant life.  
- **Straw Thread**: The local iteractor complex. Even abandoned, its systems still function.  
- **Megapolis**: The silent city that rests above *Sliver Of Straw*.
